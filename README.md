Configure Departments

Departments are needed for organization. Certain groups will be put in certain departments and certain departments will have certain tasks assigned to them. Some tasks need certain expertise to solve and that is where departments come in play.

If an issue or problem comes up and you need a group of people from different departments are needed to solve it, teams are created and assigned the issue.

Configure SLA's

SLA's or Service Level Agreements is like a set of guidelines for time management. The purpose of the SLA Plan is to provide a length of time in which the help desk Administrator expects tickets to be closed. They are differentiated by severity. High severity issues are expected to solved and taken care of quikly while low level severity issues are given more time to solve.

<p>
Help Topics

Help Topics will determine what Department the ticket is routed to, which will determine which Agents have access to the ticket. The Help Topic also can determine other configurations of the ticket, such as the ticketâ€™s SLA (or Service Level Agreement) and priority of a ticket, i.e. Emergency to Low. 

Help Topics help stream line the process and make it easier for the user and agents
