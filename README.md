Configure Roles
  Roles are permissions granted to agents. Every employee has a set of permissions and tasks that they have access to. It is important so that only the right people have access to do certain tasks.

Configure SLA's

SLA's or Service Level Agreements is like a set of guidelines for time management.

High severity issues are expected to solved and taken care of quikly while low level severity issues are given more time to solve.
